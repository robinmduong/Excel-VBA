'-----------------------------------

'CHANGES TO VERSION 4 OF THE CODE:
'the previous version worked well, but new instructions were added:

'Pseudocode:
'Go through each spreadsheet
'If the spreadsheet’s name contains the word “Summary” or “Code”, then ignore it
'Go through each line of the code in the remaining spreadsheets
'Concatenate the following:
'“Date: “
'A Column
'“ / Transaction Type: “
'B Col
'“ / Num: “
'C Col
'“ / Name: “
'D Col
'“ / Notes: “
'F Col
'Place the concatenated value into the F column cell
'Make sure your code doesn’t have an error because of self-referencing cell F
'If cell F is empty, and there are no values in cells B, C, D, E, or F, and there is a value in cell G -or- in cell H, then copy the value in cell F in the row above to the current cell F
'
'
'Delete all rows without a value in Cell F
'OUTSIDE the loops, have a MsgBox print a completion message
'MsgBox (“Done”)
'
